  Gotham is an awesome and super fast Static Site Generator. It's written in Go
  which is where it gets its speed. It can build Markdown into static and lean
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  Gotham is fully compatible with Hugo, from which it was "soft forked". You 
  can run `gotham version` to see which specific version of Hugo its compatible 
  with.
